    "#40. What are Flask templates, and how are they used in web development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask templates are files that contain HTML, CSS, and embedded Python code, allowing you to dynamically generate web pages. \n",
    "Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine for this purpose. Templates help separate the presentation layer from the application logic, \n",
    "promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. They are stored in the templates directory and rendered using the render_template function.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html')\n",
